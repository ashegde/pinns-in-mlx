This repo is an exercise in implementing Physics-Informed Neural Networks in MLX. It is still quite work-in-progress. with currently only the 1D Burgers equation implemented. Still to do:

Verify the implementation (solution, error plots, optimizer)
Include parameter domains (useful for UQ)
Compare different optimizers (currently only the SOAP optimizer is used)

The code as of now can utilized by running the ```example_burgers_1d.py``` script. This produces the following plots:
